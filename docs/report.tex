\section{Introduction}

Player ranking has many important uses in competitive sports or games. Firstly, 
they provide a basis of matchmaking systems, improving the experinces of both 
player and watchers. They can lead to balanced games for the participants, while 
keeping them dynamic for audiences. Secondly, ranking players can be used to determine 
tournament qualification (such as the access to ranked matches in Dota2). Lastly, 
ranking triggers the human ingrained response to competition, attracting players 
to stay for longer, thus benefiting the industry.

The essence of ranking algorithms is determining a real skill score for each 
player, such that its magnitude is representative of the player's future 
performances. In a probabilistic setting, these skills must also be depictive of 
the probability of games' outcome.

One of the most influential statistical ranking systems is due to Arpad Elo (1959) 
\cite{elo1978rating}, and has been used extensively in chess ranking 
\cite{glickman1995comprehensive}. In the online game scene, it has been used in 
World of Warcraft's PvP\footnote{player vs. player} matchmaking 
\footnote{\url{http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Arena_personal_rating}}. 

The core of the \emph{Elo} algorithm is that each player's game performance  
is normally distributed around their skill, $p \sim \mathcal{N}(skill, \beta^2)$.
The probability that one player wins is then proportional to the probability that 
its performance is higher than its adversary's.
\begin{align*}
	P(p_1 > p_2 | skill_1, skill_2) = \Phi\bigg(\frac{s_1 - s_2}{\sqrt{2}\beta}\bigg),
\end{align*}
where $\Phi$ is the cumulative density of a normalised Gaussian distribution. 


Seen as improvements to \emph{Elo} are the \emph{Glicko} rating systems \cite{glickman1999parameter},
\cite{glickman2012example}. They replace the constant variance parameter used by 
\emph{Elo} system by shifting to a bayesian framework. In the setting, the player skill itself 
is seen as coming from a prior distribution and, with each game, the uncertainty 
(variance) of their skill decreases. 

Unfortunately \emph{Glicko} is limited to single player games. Microsoft 
TrueSkill\texttrademark  was developed to address this limitation, by allowing 
individuals's skills to be updated given the team's performance, as well as considering
games with more than 2 competing entities.

An important question that needs yet to be addressed is how to enhance these existing
systems by incorporating other information about the players, rather than just 
win vs. loss information. For instance, in chess, incoroporate knowledge of whether 
the player controls the black or the white. 
A way in which this problem has been addressed is due to \emph{Zhang et al.} 
\cite{zhang2010factor}. They suggested that an entity skill, rather than being 
a single real value, could be understood as a vector of skill components: \emph{
a virtual team of [the player's] various skills}. Of particular interest to the 
current work is that they validate their algorithm on \emph{DotA}, a precursor of 
the game I will discuss in this work.


In the rest of this report, I will introduce factor graphs and the message passing 
algorithms, necessary for understanding the \emph{TrueSkill\texttrademark}
original implementation. I will then describe the assumptions made in the 
\emph{TrueSkill\texttrademark} model. Next, I will introduce the particularities 
of the \emph{Dota2} game, a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) that has been 
part of the advent of e-sports. Lastly, I incorporate these considerations 
into an implementation that I evaluate on both real and synthesized datasets.

\section{Implementation} \label{impl}

\subsection{Factor Graphs}

The \emph{Factor Graph} is a graph-based graphical model. Like \emph{Markov Random Fields}
or \emph{Bayesian Networks}, it is used to model multivariate probability distribution 
while making explicit the conditional independence assumptions of the random variables.
The \emph{Factor Graph} is based on a bipartite undirected graph with two types of nodes:
The \textbf{variables} (depicted as circles), and the \textbf{factors} (depicted as squares).
The factors represent functorial combinations of the neighbouring variables. The 
bipartite structure is achieved by enforcing the constraint that edges can only
connect nodes of different types.

Another way to see it is that the factor graph expresses a factorisation of a 
joint distribution.

\begin{align*}
	g(x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n)=\sum_{j \in J}f_j(\textbf{x}_j)
\end{align*}
Where $J$ is the set of factors and $\textbf{x}_j$ is the list of variables that 
are adjoint to the node represending the factor $f_j$.

We are generally interested in performing marginalisation. This is usually 
required in practise, for example when computing likelyhood functions.

\begin{align*}
	g_i(x_i) = \sum_{x_j, j \neq i}g(x_1, x_2, ... x_n)
\end{align*}

\subsection{Message Passing}

Marginalisation approximations are performed using the so called \emph{sum-product algorithm}. 
Also called \emph{Belief propagation}\cite{pearl1982reverend}, this algorithm was designed
to be a general, easily paralellisable, exact inference of graphical model
based on trees. However, it is known to provide approximations on general graphs
\cite{pearl2014probabilistic}, including cyclic graphs \cite{murphy1999loopy}.

It has been shown that this algorithm is an instance of the 
\emph{Expectation propagation}\cite{minka2001expectation} on factor graphs. 
The algorithm approximates marginals by propagating \emph{messages} along the 
edges of the factor graphs. In the context of \emph{Expectation propagation}, 
messages are nothing but factor approximations obtained in the main loop of the 
algorithm \cite{minka2001expectation}.

Concretely, message passing can be defined through the following equations:
\begin{align*}
	p(v_i) &= \prod_{f \in {F_{v_i}}}m_{f \to v_i}(v_i)  \\
	m_{f \to v_i}(v_i) &= \int...\int f(\textbf{v}) \prod_{i \neq j}m_{v_j \to f}(v_i)dv_j \\
	m_{v_i \to f}(v_i) &= \frac{p(v_i)}{m_{f \to v_i}} 
\end{align*}
In the previous, $f$ refers to a factor and $v$ to a variable node. I use the 
standard notation $m_{f \to v}$ to represent the message from node $f$ to node $v$.

\subsection{TrueSkill Implementation}

For simplification, I will introduce this problem with no-draw games consisting 
of two teams, each with two players. 

We model all players skills as being drawn from a prior distribution. This encodes
the knowledge we have about the players before begining to analyse their game 
outcomes. Then, we calculate the team performance as being the sum of the 
members' skills with an added \emph{Gaussian noise}, representing an \emph{luck}
element. Lastly, the probability of the team winning, is given by the probability 
the first team's performance is higher than the second team's performance

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{center}
	  	\input{standard_trueskill}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Original TrueSkill\texttrademark  model for a game with two teams of
	two members each. Note that, in the above I only show a small part of the full graph, 
	related to a single game. In reality, we have $N$ players and $G$ games.
	}
	\label{fig:stdts}
\end{figure}

We are interested in computing the marginal distribution, 
$
\mathbb{P}(s_i | \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{t}, \mathbf{y})
$ for each player i. We can do these by applying the sum product algorithm. 
The derivation of the message passing equation is an exercise in \emph{Gaussian}
distribution manipulations \cite{herbrich2007trueskill}. 
Notice however that we need to make two further approximations. 

Firstly, because 
of the presence of cyclic structures (since the same player can take part in 
multiple games), we will have to make use of the \emph{loopy belief propagation}
ideas and iterate a few times through the steps of the algorithm. 

Secondly, the 
efficiency of \emph{expectantion propagation} is based on having to propagate few 
moments through the network. In the case of the \emph{normal distribution}, two moments
suffice ($\mu$ and $\sigma$). However, for the factor computing $\mathbb{I}(t_0 > t_1)$,
we can apply \emph{moment matching} to approximate its result to a \emph{Gaussian}. 
This reduces to applying \emph{moment matching} on a truncated \emph{Gaussian}, say:
$t \sim \frac{1}{Z_t}\delta (t > 0) \mathcal{N}(t; \mu ,\sigma ^2)$. By using the 
notation:
\begin{align*}
	\Psi(z) &= \frac{\mathcal{N}(z;0, 1)}{\Phi(z)} \\
	\Lambda(z) &= \Psi(z)(\Psi(z) + z), \\
\intertext{We can approximate the distribution of $t$ by a Gaussian whose moments 
are \footnotemark:} 
	\mathbb{E}(t) &= \mu + \sigma\Psi(\frac{\mu}{\sigma}) \\ 
	\text{Var}(t) &= \sigma ^ 2 (1 - \Lambda(\frac{\mu}{\sigma}))
\end{align*}
\footnotetext{\url{http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/teaching/4f13/1718}}

Notice that under this model, the only factors that are open to modification are  
the prior distribution of the skills and the outcome of the game. There is no other
way to incorporate new assumptions that are valid in particular games we apply
this model to.
In the following, I will present a few simple modification that could better
fit the game of DotA2, as well as validate them on syntesized and real datasets.

\subsection{DotA2}

Dota2 (Defence of the Ancients 2) is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena(MOBA). 
The \emph{Arena} is a square map 
containing two adversary bases on opposite corners, united by three lanes heavily
guarded by turrets. There are two teams, refered to as the \emph{Radiance} and \emph{Dire},
each of which is composed of five human players. The goal of a team is to infiltrate 
the enemy base and destroy their \emph{Ancient}, a static structure. Upon achieving
this feat, the game terminates.

Each human player controls a \emph{hero} which they can chose before the game commences.
The \emph{heros} are all difference, requiring particular strategies. During 
clashes between teams, \emph{heros} might get killed, which confers their slayers
\emph{gold} and \emph{experience}. Upon death, \emph{heros} \emph{respawn} after 
a penalty time during which the player can only observe the game. 

Although this is an incomplete description of the game\footnote{\url{https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dota_2_Wiki}}
, it suffices for understanding the metrics provided by specialised datasets, such as: 
duration of the game, hero name, kills, deaths, gold per minute, xp per minute etc.

\subsubsection{Dota2 Ranking Dataset.}

For running experiment in following sections, I will be using a \emph{Kaggle}-hosted
dataset \footnote{\url{https://www.kaggle.com/owajawa/dota-2-skill-rating-with-trueskill/data}},
created by querying the OpenDota service \footnote{\url{https://www.opendota.com/}}.
This dataset contains metadata about matches (e.g. duration, geographic information
), as well about some of the players that took part in it (e.g. level, experience, 
gold, damage dealt, the hero chosen, deaths, kills etc.). Furthermore, it contains
timestamps of all the events that took part in the game, such as items bought, 
and even the text log. As the data is very rich, constructing a probabilistic model
that integrates all these variables would require some amount of domain knowledge. 
Nontheless, in the next sections, I will outline a few assumptions that we can
check about the data. 

\subsection{Assumptions about the data}

\subsubsection{Matchmaking bias}
The platform implements a matchmaking routine \footnote{\url{https://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=129665}}.
Also based on a probabilistic assumption, their algorithm assigns skill levels,
called MMR - Match Making Rating. This number, originally starting at the value of 
3000 is increased with every win and decresed with every loss. The difference depends
on the MMR difference between the two teams. 

Players will only play games with peers of a similar skill. This contradicts the 
independence assumption between the players.  

Moreover, the dataset is collected from \emph{Ranked matches}, which only allow 
access to experienced players.

\subsubsection{Anonymous players}
A substantial amount TODO of players can choose to play anonymously, accounting to 
TODO of matches. In this case, the system does not preserve any identification that 
could trace back the individual from the gameplay information. This turns out 
to be a critical problem in modelling the calculation of \emph{team performances}.
